Each line is a viewport from a previous visitor. Each line is slightly transparent, so the brighter portions are where there are multiple similar viewports. The lines are a [1000 long sample](https://github.com/iest/i-am-the-fold/blob/master/index.js#L107) of the full dataset.

If you're interested in the full dataset, [I wrote an article on my personal site](http://iest.co/webdev/2015/02/15/iamthefold-rundown.html) that looks into the numbers a bit more deeply.

This is meant to show the diversity of viewports, not the popularity of them.

Think this is cool/awesome/meh? Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_iest). When I have time I'll write a full technical rundown on my blog, [iest.co](http://iest.co).
